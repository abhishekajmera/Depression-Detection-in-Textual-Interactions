# Depression-Detection-in-textual-interactions

This project investigates depression signals in dialogues, using Multi-Task Learning (MTL) to jointly learn depression, emotion, topic, and dialogue act prediction. Experiments on the DAIC, eRisk (2018), and DailyDialog corpora demonstrate significant improvements in depression detection (up to 73.8% F1), highlighting the correlation between depression, emotion, and dialogue organization, and the effectiveness of MTL.
